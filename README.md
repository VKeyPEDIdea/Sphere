## Concept

Sphere Digital Platform is a distributed software infrastructure with highly adaptable and scalable services, capable of handling complex data and process management tasks in a wide variety of applied fields. Sphere is a comprehensive solution that works with databases, provides APIs, generates reports, and runs domain logic (business processes), and has autogenerated general-purpose and multiple custom UIs (user interfaces with tables, forms, charts, and other visual elements). Sphere supports different clients (web, mobile, desktop) and provides integration with third-party information systems over various protocols (by contract basis and dynamic binding using introspection and scaffolding). Sphere can change data entities dynamically to be adaptive in a quickly changing world (flexible and capable of changing the data model and behavior without the need for deep code rewrites). Sphere is intended to deal with large databases and complex processes; it can provide automated integration with various other information systems using different protocols and provide facilities for custom integrations. Sphere provides collaborative tools for corporate users and online communities. The codebase and knowledge base of the Sphere project are community-managed, free, open-source, and knowledge-driven. We support a holistic data-driven approach to create transparent and secure global integration hubs, reliable data processing, and data bridges between business entities and individuals in real-time.

Sphere can be applied as a core free technology for constructing the future in multiple fields: retail and supply, government, healthcare, automotive, banking, energy, insurance, education, agriculture, real estate, pharmaceuticals, tourism, e-commerce, media & entertainment, etc. It can provide services for data analytics, resource planning, integrations for the following software classes (can transparently handle data and processes): ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SCM (Supply Chain Management), FM (Financial Management), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), HRM (Human Resources Management), BI (Business Intelligence), MRP (Material Requirements Planning), EAM (Enterprise Asset Management), BPM (Business Process Management), CPM (Corporate Performance Management), CMS (Content Management System), WMS (Warehouse Management System).
